### retrive.sequences

##### $perl get.seq.upstream.pl enriched2 > enriched.with.sequences.fas # this gives you the DNA sequences for the gene ID provided in enriched2. Sequence retrived will be between 8nt and 55,000nt

##### TAIR10_upstream_1000_translation_start_20101028 # file with upstream seq from TAIR https://www.arabidopsis.org/download_files/Sequences/TAIR10_blastsets/upstream_sequences/TAIR10_upstream_1000_translation_start_20101028

##### If you change the TAIR10_upstream_1000_translation_start by the CDS file you could get the CDS for the enriched2
